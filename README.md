## Usage  
### RMBG Node
![RMBG](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd0eb92e-8f2e-4ae4-95f1-899a6d83cab6)

### Optional Settings :bulb: Tips
| Optional Settings    | :memo: Description                                                           | :bulb: Tips                                                                                   |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sensitivity**      | Adjusts the strength of mask detection. Higher values result in stricter detection. | Default value is 0.5. Adjust based on image complexity; more complex images may require higher sensitivity. |
| **Processing Resolution** | Controls the processing resolution of the input image, affecting detail and memory usage. | Choose a value between 256 and 2048, with a default of 1024. Higher resolutions provide better detail but increase memory consumption. |
| **Mask Blur**        | Controls the amount of blur applied to the mask edges, reducing jaggedness. | Default value is 0. Try setting it between 1 and 5 for smoother edge effects.                    |
| **Mask Offset**      | Allows for expanding or shrinking the mask boundary. Positive values expand the boundary, while negative values shrink it. | Default value is 0. Adjust based on the specific image, typically fine-tuning between -10 and 10. |
| **Background**      | Choose output background color | Alpha (transparent background) Black, White, Green, Blue, Red |
| **Invert Output**      | Flip mask and image output | Invert both image and mask output |
| **Refine Foreground** | Use Fast Foreground Color Estimation to optimize transparent background | Enable for better edge quality and transparency handling |
| **Performance Optimization** | Properly setting options can enhance performance when processing multiple images. | If memory allows, consider increasing `process_res` and `mask_blur` values for better results, but be mindful of memory usage. |
